Leaderboard for AAA

To View:

In command line, install NPM packages with `npm i`

Run `npm run start`

Page should open on `http://localhost:3000/`

Current thoughts:

- Page will run continously and pull scoreboard data from a data.json file that will get updated whenever a hunter returns to input their score. (Perhaps every 2-3 minutes so scores are most up to date)

- The page will randomly switch between different themes/fonts/etc (probably RNG of 5-10 minutes?)

Currently working on:

- Theming design
- RNG for theme switching

TODO:

1. Check with Zach about if RasberryPI will be able to open the json file, filter or find an object based on ID, increment the score and then re-save.
2. Add sorting logic for the ranks to be correct. All in due time
